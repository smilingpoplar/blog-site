        <h3 id="lec08-how-to-get-started"><a href="#lec08-how-to-get-started" class="headerlink" title="lec08: how to get started"></a>lec08: how to get started</h3><p>doing things that don’t scale also allows you to become an expert in your business, like driving helped us understand how the whole delivery process worked. We used that as an opportunity to talk to our customers, talk to restaurants. We did dispatching which helped us figure out what our driver assignment algorithms should look like. We did customer support ourselves, getting real-time feedback from customers.</p>
<p>In the beginning, competition doesn’t really matter when you’re getting started.</p>
<h3 id="lec09-how-to-raise-money"><a href="#lec09-how-to-raise-money" class="headerlink" title="lec09: how to raise money"></a>lec09: how to raise money</h3><p>Literally while you are talking to me in the first minute I am saying “Is this person a leader?” “Is this person rightful, focused, and obsessed by the product?” I am hoping—because usually the first question I ask is “What inspired you to create this product?”—I’m hoping that it’s based on a personal problem that that founder had and this product is the solution to that personal problem. Then I am looking for communication skills, because if you are going to be a leader and hire a team, assuming your product is successful, you have to be a really good communicator and you have to be a born leader.</p>
<p><a href="/images/what-ron-and-sv-angel-look-for-in-a-company.png">What Ron and SV Angel Look for in a Company</a></p>
<p>aising venture capital is the easiest thing a startup founder is ever going to do. As compared to recruiting engineers. In particular as compared to recruiting engineer number twenty. It’s far harder than raising venture capital. Selling to  enterprise customers is harder , getting viral growth going on a consumer business is harder, getting advertising revenue is harder, almost everything you’ll ever do is harder than raising venture capital.</p>
<p>don’t ask people to sign an NDA. We rarely get asked any more because most founders have figured out that if you ask someone for a NDA at the front end of the relationship you are basically saying, I don’t trust you. So the relationship between investors and founders involves lots of trust.</p>
<p>my advice on the fundraising process is do it as quickly and efficiently as you possibly can. Don’t obsess over it. For some reason, founders get their ego involved in fundraising where it is a personal victory. It is the tiniest step on the way as Marc said. And it’s the most fundamental. Hurry up and get it over with.</p>
<p>in the process, when somebody makes the commitment to you, you get in your car, and you type an email to them that confirms what they just said to you. Because a lot of investors have very short memories and they forget that they were going to finance you, that they were going to finance or they forget what the valuation was, that they were going to find a co-investor. You can get rid of all that controversy just by putting it in writing and when they try and get out of it you just resend the email and say excuse me. And hopefully they have replied to that email anyways so get it in writing. In meetings take notes and follow up on what’s important.</p>
<p>seed stage: probably going to sell <strong>10%~15%</strong> of the company</p>
<p>series A: probably going to sell <strong>20%~30%</strong> of the company</p>
<p>If it is an investor that has no domain expertise in your company, does not have a rolodex where they can help you with introductions both for business development and in helping you do the intros for Series A, you should not take that person’s money. Especially if they are in it just to make money. And you can suss those people out pretty quickly.</p>
<p>if things going well the founder is in control, and if things going badly investors are in control</p>
<h3 id="lec12-build-for-the-enterprise"><a href="#lec12-build-for-the-enterprise" class="headerlink" title="lec12: build for the enterprise"></a>lec12: build for the enterprise</h3><p>You want to do things that incumbents can’t or won’t do because either the economics don’t make sense for them, the economics are so unusual, or because technically they can’t.</p>
<p>Listen to your customers but don’t always build exactly what they want. Build what they need.</p>
<h3 id="lec13-how-to-be-a-great-founder"><a href="#lec13-how-to-be-a-great-founder" class="headerlink" title="lec13: how to be a great founder"></a>lec13: how to be a great founder</h3><p>frequently it’s very hard to tell the difference between madness and genius because usually it’s the results that play out</p>
<p>it’s best to have two or three people on a team rather than a solo</p>
<p>talk to every smart person who will talk to you and give you feedback</p>
<p>when you think about being contrarian, you have to think about how is it that smart people disagree with me, that disagree with me from a position of intelligence. And there is something that I know that they don’t know that will actually play out to be true.</p>
<p>part of what being a great founder, is being both able to hold the belief, to think about where it is you want to be going, but also be smart enough that you are essentially listening to criticism, negative feedback, competitive entries</p>
<p>to say coherently what you are targeting, to articulate something. if you don’t have that level of clarity, you are not going to be able to assemble the network behind you</p>
<h3 id="lec14-how-to-operate"><a href="#lec14-how-to-operate" class="headerlink" title="lec14: how to operate"></a>lec14: how to operate</h3><p>Your job is to clarify and simplify things for everybody on your team. The more you simplify, the better people will perform.</p>
<p>So force yourself to simply every initiative, every product, every marketing, everything you do. Ask a lot of questions to clarify things. </p>
<p>We try to narrow down to, what are the one two three four things that matter most to this company? And only focus on those things. So it allows us to be more decisive and we can make decision rapidly. It allows us not to distract you from your day job which is actually building a company. </p>
<h4 id="delegate"><a href="#delegate" class="headerlink" title="delegate"></a>delegate</h4><p>task relevant maturity: has this person ever done this before? And the more they have done the exact same task before, the more rope you are going to give them. And the more they are trying something new, the more you are going to instruct them and constantly monitor. </p>
<p>task relevant maturity: Low (Hightly structed: what, when, how) &lt;—&gt; High (Monitor and set objectives)</p>
<p>Mostly great people actually are ammunition. But what you need in your company are barrels. The definition of a barrel is, they can take an idea from conception and take it all the way to shipping and bring people with them. </p>
<p>How can you tell who is a barrel and who is not? One is you start with a very small set of responsibilities, it can be very trivial. And expand the scope of responsibilities until it breaks. That’s actually what you want to do with every single employee, every single day. And what you want to do is keep expanding it until you see where it breaks and that’s the role they should stay in.</p>
<p>The other signal to look for is once you’ve hired someone, with an open office, just watch who goes up to other people’s desks. Particularly people they don’t report to. If someone keeps going to some individual employees desk and they don’t report them, it’s a sign that they believe that person can help them. If you see that consistently, those are your barrels. Just promote them, give them as much opportunity as you can.</p>
<p>Create notes for every meeting and send them to the entire company. So as the company adds employees, everyone feels that they continue to track what is interesting, what is going on. And they never feel excluded. </p>
<p>Every conference room has glass walls. Because as soon as you have regular walls, people wonder what’s going on. It’s amazing, if they can see who exactly is in the meeting and who is meeting with who when, they don’t start to worry nearly as much as about what’s going on behind those closed doors.</p>
<p>Have a one on one meeting with employee roughly every two weeks. Some people say every week, but I wouldn’t go longer than two weeks. The agenda should be crafted by the employee that reports the manager, not the manager. They should walk in with, these are the three things I want to talk about. Even bullet points in advance by email so you have time to chew on it, and you’re not on the fly winging your answers.</p>
<p>以团队的人均产出作为管理者的绩效，可保证团队规模适度</p>
